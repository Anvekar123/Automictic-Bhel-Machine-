# Calculation of Mass
 ## 1.Mass of legs 

m = Volume X Density

Volume =   Pi * (R)^2 * X Height 

       = 3.142 X (0.525)^2 x 40
      
       = 34.64Cm^3

     m = Volume X Density 
  
       = 34.64  X 2.7

     m = 93.53 g

     m = 93.53 X 4
 
       = 374.12g



2. Mass of Square sheet

Volume = Length X Breadth X Thickness 

       = 40 X 40 X 4 X 10^-2
       
       = 3200 cm^3

     m = V X Density   
      
       = 755.2g


3. Mass of storage containers 

 V  = (10 x 10 x 0.4 x 4) + (10 x 10 x 0.4 )-(3.142 x 4 x 0.4)

    = 160 + 40 - 5
   
    = 195 x 4 (Containers)


 V  = 780 cm^3

  m = V x Density 
 
  m = 780 x 1.18
    
  m = 920.4g


4. Mass of Mixing Containers 

   m = 160g


# Mass of rotating part

  mass of 3D printed teeth = 80g

  mass of the ball bearing = 0.8*2.2*0.7*8.03 = 9.89g

  mass of 1 rods = 16* (0.525)^2 * 3.142 *  = 13.85 g

  mass of 1 rods = 25 * (0.525)^2 * 3.142 *  =21.65 g
  
  mass of plastic pot = 160g

  mass of 3D printed rod = 70g

  Total mass = 355.39g
             = 0.3554kg
 
# Total Mass of model

 T= 374.12g + 755.2g + 920.4g + 160g  + 355.39g


  = 2565.11g

  = 2.56Kg

# Force of Model
Force=coefficient of friction * mass ( Mass of rotating part + Jhalmuri )


      =0.4* (355.39 g + 50g)

Force =162.156N 

#Torque of model
 Torque = force * radius
        = 0.162156 *  12
        = 1.946 NCm

FOS =  1.946 * 1.5 
    =  2.919 


# POWER  
 P = ( 2 * 3.142 * 150 * 1.946 ) / 60
 P = 30.57 Watts
  
# Motor And Adapter Selection
 
Thus we are selecting DC Motor of 60rpm with 12 volt Adapter and 2amp current
